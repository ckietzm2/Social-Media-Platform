# Social-Media-Platform
Simple social media platform for user, friends and comments

The social media platform is strictly the back end of a social media app.  It allows a user to see add a thought, a response to a thought and add a friend.  The user and thought routes allow a user to add/delete/update/get either a thought or a user.  Each user and thought have a unique ID created by MongoDB.  Please see the video below on how it works on Insomnia.
